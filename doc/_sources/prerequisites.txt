Python modules and binds
-----------------------
Indeed, as long as it works in Python, we need the Python interepreter installed. This framework as been made for 2.x version of Python, so if you want to install
Python, download the last 2.x version of this interpreter on `Python's Website <http://www.python.org/download/releases/>`_.

Secondly, there are some modules which require WMI for Python installed, so do not forget to download and install `Python WMI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/WMI/#downloads>`_.

In some cases, moniker construction could fail. To fix it, you can also install `pywin32 <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/>`_.

WMI permissions
----------------
Remote access
############
WMI uses DCOM to handle remote calls, and a failure should happened when we want to try any connection to a WMI namespace (Due to a "DCOM Access Denied" error).
To fix it, we have to grand permissions for a specific user or group in every computers we want to monitor, `as described here <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa393266%28v=vs.85%29.aspx>`_. 

Windows Firewall
################
Check the configuration to be sure if the traffic for Windows Management Instrumentation is allowed. `Click here to learn more about Windows Firewall Settings <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/>`_.
